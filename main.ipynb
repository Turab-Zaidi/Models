Time: time value of money.\\nExample. $1,000 today vs. $1,000 next year.\\n2. Risk: risk premium.\\nExample. $1,000 for sure vs. $0 and $2,000 with equal odds.\\nTime and uncertainty are two key elements in ﬁnance.\\n15.401 Lecture Notes c/circlecopyrtJ.

How much is a sure cash ﬂow of $1,100 in one year\\nworth now?\\nSafe assets in ﬁnancial markets oﬀer 5% annual return.A potential buyer of the sure CF also expects 5% return. Let the\\nprice be\\nX.T h e n\\nX(1 + 0 .05) = 1 ,100.\\nThus,\\nX=1,100\\n1.05=$ 1 ,048\\nwhich is the CF’s present value , i.e., its current market value.\\nObservation : Present value must properly adjust for time.\\nFall 2006 c/circlecopyrtJ.

How much is a risky cash ﬂow in one year with a\\nforecasted value of $1,100 worth now?\\nAssets of similar risk in ﬁnancial markets oﬀer 20% return.\\nA potential buyer of the risky CF also expects 20% return. Let\\nthe price be X.T h e n\\nX(1 + 0 .20) = 1 ,100.\\nThus, the present value of the risky CF is\\nX=1,100\\n1.20= $917 .\\nObservation : Present value must properly adjust for risk.\\nThe diﬀerence in (expected) return between risky and safe assets\\nis the risk premium .\\nThe present value of an CF equals its expected value discounted\\nat the opportunity cost of captial.\\n15.401 Lecture Notes c/circlecopyrtJ.

Allocating resources:\\n•Across time.\\nExample – Borrow money to buy a home.\\n•Across diﬀerent states of economy.\\nExample – Invest in stocks/bonds.\\n2.

Factors aﬀecting a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial objective:\\n•Timing?\\n•Risk?\\n•Accounting?\\n•“Long-run” value?\\n•...\\n2. Maximizing current market value is the only plausible ﬁnancial\\nobjective.\\n3. Current market value incorporates present value of all current\\nand future cash ﬂows, adjusted for timing and risk.\\n4. Market value rule is independent of shareholders’ diﬀerences.\\nManager objective: Maximize current market value of the ﬁrm.\\n15.401 Lecture Notes c/circlecopyrtJ. Wang Fall 2006Chapter 1 Introduction to Finance 1-15\\nExample . 50MD is a small company traded on NASDAQ. Three\\nmembers of the founding family, Granny, Father and Son, jointly\\nown a controlling interest. You, as the CEO of 50MD, areevaluating two new business plans, A and B, and conclude:\\n•Both have positive net PVs (NPV) but only one can be taken.\\n•A pays oﬀ in three years and B starts to payoﬀ after ten years.\\n•B is much riskier than A.\\n•B has a higher NPV.\\nYou recommend B over A, but all three shareholders object:\\n1. Granny: “Kid, you missed one thing: I am 85 now and\\nprobably could not wait to see any payoﬀ if we take B.”\\n2. Father: “I just got the membership at my favorite golf club\\nand am set to enjoy. I am not prepared to give that all up.”\\n3. Son: “I have talked to my buddy, who is a reputable analyst\\nof the industry. He says that although your forecast about Bis in agreement with the market consensus, the market is over\\nheated about this line of business and in his view B is a loser.”\\nWhat would you say to them?\\nFall 2006 c/circlecopyrtJ. Wang 15.401 Lecture Notes1-16 Introduction to Finance Chapter 1\\nThe Case for Value Maximization:\\n1. Shareholders’ ﬁnancial objectives:\\n(a) Increase of total wealth\\n(b) Right allocation of wealth over time\\n(c) Right allocation of wealth over future contingencies.\\n2. Shareholders can do (b) and (c) on their own, through ﬁnancial\\nmarkets.\\n3. Financial manager can help only with (a), by increasing ﬁrm’s\\nmarket value (i.e., shareholders’ total wealth).\\n15.401 Lecture Notes c/circlecopyrtJ. Wang Fall 2006Chapter 1 Introduction to Finance 1-17\\nConclusions:\\n1. Managers should maximize ﬁrm’s current market value.\\n2. Shareholder diﬀerences can be settled in ﬁnancial markets by\\ntrading on their own account.\\n3. Perfect ﬁnancial markets allow separation of ownership and\\nmanagement.\\nPractical Issues:\\n•Agency problems\\n-Management may put their own interest ﬁrst.\\n•Other stakeholders\\n-Diﬀerent stakeholders may have conﬂicting interests.\\n•Imperfections in ﬁnancial markets.\\nFall 2006 c/circlecopyrtJ. Wang 15.401 Lecture Notes1-18 Introduction to Finance Chapter 1\\n5 Summary\\nKey Points:\\n1. Objective of managers: maximize ﬁrm’s current market value.\\n2. Evaluating a business boils down to valuation of its assets.3. An asset is deﬁned by its cash ﬂow (CF).4. Two important characteristics of CF: timing and risk.5. Value of assets (CFs) are determined by ﬁnancial markets.6. Cost of capital: Expected return on equivalent investments in\\nﬁnancial markets.\\n7. Present value: Value of a CF is its expected value discounted\\nat the opportunity cost of capital, which adjusts for both timeand risk.\\nKey Assumptions:\\n1. “Perfect” ﬁnancial markets.\\n2. No agency problems and conﬂicts among stackholders.\\n15.401 Lecture Notes c/circlecopyrtJ.
